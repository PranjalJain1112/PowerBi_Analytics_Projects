## üßÆ Key DAX Measures

Designed analytical measures to provide both **historical trends** and **forward-looking perspectives**:

- **Growth & Trend Analysis** ‚Äì Leveraged `CALCULATE`, `TOTALYTD`, and `DATESINPERIOD` to compute year-over-year growth and rolling period trends.
- **Market Pricing Intelligence** ‚Äì Used `MEDIANX` to monitor price movements and detect shifts in median sales across different regions and timeframes.
- **Context-Aware Metrics** ‚Äì Applied `ALLEXCEPT` and logical functions (`IF`, `BLANK`) to ensure accurate KPI calculations while respecting user-selected filters.
- **Time-Based Segmentation** ‚Äì Implemented `YEAR` and `QUARTER` for seasonal sales performance analysis.
